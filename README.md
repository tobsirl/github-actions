# GitHub Actions

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a feature that enables you to automate your workflow. It is a tool that allows you to build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. It is integrated with GitHub and you can find it in the Actions tab of your repository.

## What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. It is a set of principles and practices that help teams deliver features faster and more reliably. CI/CD is a solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams (AKA "integration hell").

### Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. It is a process of automating the build and testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version control.

### Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery is the practice of automating the release of software so that it can be released at any time. It is a software development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production.
